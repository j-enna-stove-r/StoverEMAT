    "My data is in the process of downloading. Spotify said it could take up to 30 days to download my data so I do not believe I downloaded the data correctly. The data structure I will use will include data from each month of my Spotify listening data. How I collected the data was through the Spotify app. I went to my account's privacy page and scrolled to the bottom where I clicked the button of request data. I was then sent a confirmation email where I confirmed that I wanted my data downloaded and a follow up email where they said the data request could take up to 30 days. I believe there is a simpler way to download my data that would not take up to 30 days but I could not find the link in the Canvas. The description of data I will be collecting is my lifetime streaming history including track information, when/ how I streamed the content, saved items in my library, searches, subscription data, podcast interactivity, playlists, etc.."
